<Update label="February 20, 2026" description="Evaluations: Confidence in Every Conversation">
    Evaluations give you a systematic way to verify that your agent handles real-world scenarios the way you expect. Define a user persona and a set of success criteria, and Dimedove simulates a full multi-turn conversation with your agent, then scores the result with an independent AI judge. Every time you update your agent's instructions, knowledge base, tone, or tasks, you can run your evaluations to confirm nothing broke and everything still works.

    Each evaluation follows a three-step lifecycle: define, run, review. The simulated user stays in character throughout the conversation, writing naturally and reacting realistically to your agent's responses. Once the conversation completes, an independent judge evaluates the full transcript against each criterion you defined, producing a score and a pass, partial, or fail verdict. A detailed reasoning section and per-criterion breakdown show exactly what worked, what did not, and why.

    Run evaluations individually or all at once after making changes. Every run is saved with its score, verdict, and full conversation transcript, so you can track how your agent's performance evolves over time. Pair evaluations with Versions to test a draft configuration before publishing it to production.

    - **Scenario-based testing** with realistic, natural user simulation
    - **AI-powered scoring** with an independent judge evaluating each success criterion
    - **Pass, partial, and fail verdicts** with scoring for granular insight
    - **Full conversation transcripts** for every run, viewable turn by turn
    - **Run individually or all at once** to validate your agent after any change
    - **Run history** to track performance over time and catch regressions

    ### Features

    - Create evaluations with custom user scenarios describing who the visitor is and what they are trying to accomplish
    - Define success criteria that tell the judge exactly what a passing conversation looks like
    - Configure the maximum number of conversation turns per evaluation
    - Simulated users stay in character, write naturally, and react realistically to your agent's responses
    - Independent AI judge evaluates the full transcript against each defined criterion

<Update label="February 11, 2026" description="Workflows: Automate Across Every Channel">
    Workflows bring event-driven automation to Dimedove. Connect any platform event to a sequence of actions, without writing code or leaving the dashboard. When a form is submitted, an email arrives, a call comes in, an agent qualifies a lead, or a Slack message is received, workflows let you automatically respond with emails, SMS messages, outbound calls, Slack messages, or HTTP requests to external systems.

    Each workflow starts with a trigger (the event that kicks things off) and executes up to two action steps in sequence. Nine trigger types cover every channel on the platform, and optional filters let you narrow triggers to specific agents, forms, phone numbers, email channels, or Slack agents. Six action types give you full cross-channel reach, including a Delay action for timed sequences like waiting before a follow-up call. When actions are sent through agent-assigned channels, they automatically create conversations in your Inbox, so your team has full visibility and agents can continue the interaction.

    Template variables make workflows dynamic: reference any field from the trigger payload in your action configurations using `{{trigger.body.field_name}}` syntax, with dot notation and array index support for nested data. A built-in run history with step-by-step details and an analytics dashboard give you complete visibility into every execution.

    - **Multiple trigger types** covering webhooks, manual runs, qualified opportunities, human assistance requests, form submissions, inbound emails, inbound calls, inbound SMS, and Slack messages
    - **Multiple action types** including HTTP Request, Email, SMS, Call, Slack Message, and Delay
    - **Optional trigger filters** to narrow events to specific agents, forms, phone numbers, email channels, or Slack agents
    - **Template variables** for dynamic data in action configurations
    - **Inbox integration** with automatic conversation creation from email, SMS, and call actions
    - **Run history and analytics** with step-by-step execution details, success rate, and duration tracking

    ### Features

    - Create workflows from the dashboard with a visual editor showing triggers, actions, and connections
    - Choose from multiple trigger types: Webhook, Manual, Qualified Opportunity, Human Required, Form Submission, Email Received, Inbound Call, Inbound SMS, and Slack Message Received

<Update label="January 13, 2026" description="Emails: Forward, Respond, Repeat">
    Emails let your agents handle inbound email conversations. Forward emails from your business addresses to a Dimedove-generated inbound address, assign an agent, and responses go out automatically. You can verify your own domain to send replies from your business address instead of the Dimedove address, with DNS-based verification for DKIM authentication.

    All email threads appear in your unified Inbox alongside chat, phone, SMS, and Slack. Team members can take over conversations when needed, with configurable handoff behavior: permanent takeover or automatic resume after a timeout. Composition settings include custom signatures, CC/BCC recipients, quoted thread inclusion, and original CC preservation.

<Update label="January 6, 2026" description="MCP Support: Extend and Expose Your Agents">
    We're introducing full Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, giving your agents two powerful new capabilities: connect to external MCP servers to extend what your agents can do, and deploy your own hosted MCP servers to expose your agents to the broader AI ecosystem. Whether you want to bring third-party tools into your agent conversations or make your agents accessible from ChatGPT, automation platforms, and other AI tools, MCP makes it possible.

    MCP Tasks let your agents connect to any MCP-compatible server during conversations. Configure the server URL, choose your transport protocol, add custom headers for authentication, and your agent automatically discovers and uses the available tools. This opens up integrations with specialized services, custom APIs, and external capabilities that extend your agent far beyond its built-in functionality. A trust acknowledgment ensures you maintain control over which third-party servers your agents can access.

    MCP Servers flip the script: instead of consuming external tools, you expose your Dimedove agents as tools that other applications can use. Create a hosted MCP server from your dashboard, assign an agent, select which tasks to expose, and optionally enable knowledge base access. Dimedove manages all the infrastructure, so there are no servers to deploy or maintain. Your agents become accessible to ChatGPT apps, AI automation tools like n8n, Make, Gumloop, and Zapier, AI assistants and copilots, and any MCP-compatible client. Built-in rate limiting and analytics give you visibility and control over external usage.

    - **MCP Tasks** for connecting agents to external MCP servers and third-party tools
    - **MCP Servers** for exposing your agents via Dimedove-hosted MCP endpoints
    - **Selective task exposure** to control exactly what external tools can access
    - **Knowledge base access** toggle for MCP server queries
    - **Connection testing** to verify MCP configurations before going live
    - **Built-in rate limiting** and usage analytics for MCP servers

    ### Features

    - Create MCP tasks that connect to any external MCP server during conversations
    - Configure server URL, transport protocol (Streamable HTTP or SSE), and custom headers
    - Automatic tool discovery from connected MCP servers
    - Trust acknowledgment workflow for third-party MCP server connections
    - Create and manage MCP servers from Settings > MCP in your dashboard
    - Assign any published agent to an MCP server

<Update label="November 28, 2025" description="Attachments & Dictation: Richer Conversations">
    We're introducing two powerful new ways for visitors to communicate with your agents: file attachments and voice dictation. These features make conversations richer, more accessible, and more efficient for everyone.

    With attachments enabled, visitors can share images and documents directly in the chat. Your agent can analyze uploaded files, extract relevant information, and use that context to provide better responses. No more asking visitors to copy and paste document contents or describe images in detail.

    Dictation brings voice input to your agent conversations. Visitors can tap the microphone button and speak their messages naturally. Their speech is transcribed in real-time using their device's built-in recognition, and they can review and edit the text before sending. This is especially valuable for mobile users and makes your agent more accessible to everyone.

    - **File attachments** for sharing images and documents in conversations
    - **Document analysis** enabling agents to extract and reference information from uploaded files
    - **Voice dictation** using device-native speech recognition

<Update
  label="November 13, 2025"
  description="Agent Versions, Labels, and Forms Upgrades"
>
    We're rolling out a major set of improvements that help teams iterate faster, organize conversations at scale, and capture data more reliably. First up: Agent Versions. You can now create multiple versions of an agent's configuration, preview how each behaves, and switch or roll out changes with confidence using a two-step deployment flow. This makes it easy to A/B test instructions, tasks, or knowledge and evolve your agent without disrupting production.

    Next, we're introducing Labels: a powerful way to automatically categorize conversations. Define the labels that matter to your business (e.g., product fit, priority, intent), and Dimedove will auto-assign them based on the exchange. Labels appear right in the Inbox for quick scanning and can be managed centrally, giving your team new ways to segment, personalize, and report on outcomes.

    We've also upgraded Forms to be more resilient and structured. You can enable auto-submit to finalize a Form as soon as the agent collects all required inputs, and specify the exact question order the agent should follow. Under the hood, we improved how agents handle task inputs, especially AI-inferred prompts, and tightened email format validation for cleaner data.

    To round things out, we added a conversation toolbar in the Inbox so you can mark threads as requiring human assistance, quickly export messages, and manually assign labels when needed. A new notifications center lets each teammate subscribe to essential email alerts like "human assistance required" or "qualified opportunity," so nothing slips through the cracks.

    And on mobile, the Messenger received a significant UX upgrade with much smoother virtual keyboard handling and layout polish to keep conversations fluid on every device.

    - **Agent Versions** to safely test, preview, and deploy configuration changes with a two-step flow
    - **Auto-assigned Labels** for smarter conversation categorization and faster prioritization in the Inbox
    - **Inbox conversation toolbar** to request human help, export messages, and assign labels manually
    - **Forms upgrades** with auto-submit, precise question ordering, and stronger task/input handling
    - **Notifications center** for opt-in email alerts on key events
    - **Mobile Messenger improvements** with drastically better virtual keyboard handling and UX on small screens

    ### Features

    - Create and manage multiple agent configuration versions; preview outputs, A/B test behavior, and switch live versions without downtime
    - Two-step deployment separates editing from publishing so production remains stable while you iterate
    - Define team labels that are automatically assigned to conversations based on agent understanding; view and filter labels directly in the Inbox

<Update label="October 9, 2025" description="Conversational Forms: Human-Like Data Collection at Scale">
    We're excited to introduce Forms, a revolutionary approach to prospect qualification that transforms rigid data collection into natural, engaging conversations. Traditional forms force prospects into checkboxes and text fields, limiting the richness and authenticity of the information they share. Forms solve this by deploying your AI agents in a dedicated channel explicitly designed for conversational data collection, enabling you to gather diverse, nuanced insights that traditional input fields could never capture.

    Forms are perfect for businesses qualifying prospects at scale who need specific datapoints to optimize their conversion flow. Each Form gives your agent a focused mission: collect a defined set of inputs through natural dialogue while leveraging all your existing agent configurations and instructions. You can customize the agent's behavior specifically for each Form, ensuring the conversation aligns perfectly with your qualification goals. The beauty is in the flexibility: prospects can share complex information, clarify details, and provide context in their own words, all while your agent intelligently guides them through the process.

    Setting up Forms is effortless. Create a Form, define the data you need, customize your agent's approach, and Dimedove hosts and manages the entire experience. Each Form gets a shareable link you can embed anywhere: in emails, on landing pages, in ads, or wherever your prospects are. You can assign external IDs for tracking, configure redirect URLs for post-submission flows, and set up webhooks to instantly push collected data into your own systems. Every Form conversation appears in your unified Inbox alongside chat, phone, and SMS interactions, giving you complete visibility across all engagement channels.

    Forms also support full internationalization, adapting to any language your agent's business supports, and include built-in preview and testing capabilities so you can perfect the flow before going live.

    - **Conversational Forms** for natural, human-like data collection
    - **Rich data capture** beyond traditional form inputs and constraints
