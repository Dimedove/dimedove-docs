<Update
  label="November 13, 2025"
  description="Agent Versions, Labels, and Forms Upgrades"
>
    We're rolling out a major set of improvements that help teams iterate faster, organize conversations at scale, and capture data more reliably. First up: Agent Versions. You can now create multiple versions of an agent's configuration, preview how each behaves, and switch or roll out changes with confidence using a two-step deployment flow. This makes it easy to A/B test instructions, tasks, or knowledge and evolve your agent without disrupting production.

    Next, we're introducing Labels: a powerful way to automatically categorize conversations. Define the labels that matter to your business (e.g., product fit, priority, intent), and Dimedove will auto-assign them based on the exchange. Labels appear right in the Inbox for quick scanning and can be managed centrally, giving your team new ways to segment, personalize, and report on outcomes.

    We've also upgraded Forms to be more resilient and structured. You can enable auto-submit to finalize a Form as soon as the agent collects all required inputs, and specify the exact question order the agent should follow. Under the hood, we improved how agents handle task inputs, especially AI-inferred prompts, and tightened email format validation for cleaner data.

    To round things out, we added a conversation toolbar in the Inbox so you can mark threads as requiring human assistance, quickly export messages, and manually assign labels when needed. A new notifications center lets each teammate subscribe to essential email alerts like "human assistance required" or "qualified opportunity," so nothing slips through the cracks.

    And on mobile, the Messenger received a significant UX upgrade with much smoother virtual keyboard handling and layout polish to keep conversations fluid on every device.

    - **Agent Versions** to safely test, preview, and deploy configuration changes with a two-step flow
    - **Auto-assigned Labels** for smarter conversation categorization and faster prioritization in the Inbox
    - **Inbox conversation toolbar** to request human help, export messages, and assign labels manually
    - **Forms upgrades** with auto-submit, precise question ordering, and stronger task/input handling
    - **Notifications center** for opt-in email alerts on key events
    - **Mobile Messenger improvements** with drastically better virtual keyboard handling and UX on small screens

<Update label="October 9, 2025" description="Conversational Forms: Human-Like Data Collection at Scale">
    We're excited to introduce Forms, a revolutionary approach to prospect qualification that transforms rigid data collection into natural, engaging conversations. Traditional forms force prospects into checkboxes and text fields, limiting the richness and authenticity of the information they share. Forms solve this by deploying your AI agents in a dedicated channel explicitly designed for conversational data collection, enabling you to gather diverse, nuanced insights that traditional input fields could never capture.

    Forms are perfect for businesses qualifying prospects at scale who need specific datapoints to optimize their conversion flow. Each Form gives your agent a focused mission: collect a defined set of inputs through natural dialogue while leveraging all your existing agent configurations and instructions. You can customize the agent's behavior specifically for each Form, ensuring the conversation aligns perfectly with your qualification goals. The beauty is in the flexibility: prospects can share complex information, clarify details, and provide context in their own words, all while your agent intelligently guides them through the process.

    Setting up Forms is effortless. Create a Form, define the data you need, customize your agent's approach, and Dimedove hosts and manages the entire experience. Each Form gets a shareable link you can embed anywhere: in emails, on landing pages, in ads, or wherever your prospects are. You can assign external IDs for tracking, configure redirect URLs for post-submission flows, and set up webhooks to instantly push collected data into your own systems. Every Form conversation appears in your unified Inbox alongside chat, phone, and SMS interactions, giving you complete visibility across all engagement channels.

    Forms also support full internationalization, adapting to any language your agent's business supports, and include built-in preview and testing capabilities so you can perfect the flow before going live.

    - **Conversational Forms** for natural, human-like data collection
    - **Rich data capture** beyond traditional form inputs and constraints
    - **Agent-powered qualification** at scale with intelligent conversation flows
    - **Fully hosted and managed** shareable Form links by Dimedove
    - **Custom Form configurations** with agent behavior tailored per Form
    - **External ID tracking** and post-conversation webhooks for seamless integrations
    - **Unified Inbox integration** showing all Form conversations alongside other channels
    - **Multi-language support** with automatic Form internationalization
    - **Preview and testing** capabilities to validate flows before deployment
