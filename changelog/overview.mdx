<Update label="October 9, 2025" description="Conversational Forms: Human-Like Data Collection at Scale">
We're excited to introduce Forms, a revolutionary approach to prospect qualification that transforms rigid data collection into natural, engaging conversations. Traditional forms force prospects into checkboxes and text fields, limiting the richness and authenticity of the information they share. Forms solve this by deploying your AI agents in a dedicated channel explicitly designed for conversational data collection — enabling you to gather diverse, nuanced insights that traditional input fields could never capture.

Forms are perfect for businesses qualifying prospects at scale who need specific datapoints to optimize their conversion flow. Each Form gives your agent a focused mission: collect a defined set of inputs through natural dialogue while leveraging all your existing agent configurations and instructions. You can customize the agent's behavior specifically for each Form, ensuring the conversation aligns perfectly with your qualification goals. The beauty is in the flexibility — prospects can share complex information, clarify details, and provide context in their own words, all while your agent intelligently guides them through the process.

Setting up Forms is effortless. Create a Form, define the data you need, customize your agent's approach, and Dimedove hosts and manages the entire experience. Each Form gets a shareable link you can embed anywhere — in emails, on landing pages, in ads, or wherever your prospects are. You can assign external IDs for tracking, configure redirect URLs for post-submission flows, and set up webhooks to instantly push collected data into your own systems. Every Form conversation appears in your unified Inbox alongside chat, phone, and SMS interactions, giving you complete visibility across all engagement channels.

Forms also support full internationalization, adapting to any language your agent's business supports, and include built-in preview and testing capabilities so you can perfect the flow before going live.

<Update label="September 19, 2025" description="Telephony Support: Voice Calls & SMS">
We're thrilled to announce native telephony support, bringing your AI agents to voice and SMS channels. Phone calls and text messaging remain natural, trusted, and accessible ways for many prospects to reach businesses. Whether someone prefers the convenience of a quick text or the personal touch of a phone conversation, your agents are now ready to engage meaningfully on both channels.

Setting up telephony is remarkably simple. Purchase a managed phone number directly from the Dimedove dashboard, enable calls and/or SMS, assign your agent, and you're live. No complex integrations, no technical overhead — just seamless deployment to voice and text channels. Your agents leverage state-of-the-art voice models engineered for low latency and natural, delightful voice experiences that feel genuinely human.

What makes this truly powerful is continuity. Every phone call and SMS conversation appears directly in your unified Inbox alongside all other interactions. Insights, contact details, and conversation history flow seamlessly across channels. Even better, visitors are recognized by their phone number, allowing agents to pick up conversations exactly where they left off — whether the last interaction was a text, a call, or a web chat. This level of personalization across voice and SMS creates an agent experience unlike anything available today.
