## Basic Settings

### Channel Name

Internal identifier for organizing email channels. Not shown to customers.

### Agent Assignment

- Every email channel must be connected to an agent
- Agent must be in "Live" status before the channel can be enabled
- One agent can handle multiple email channels
- Changing agent takes effect immediately for new emails

### Forwarding Addresses

A reference list of business email addresses that forward to this channel.

- For documentation purposes only
- Helps track which addresses route to this channel
- Does not configure forwarding (that happens in your email provider)

## Inbound Address

Each email channel receives a unique inbound address automatically generated by Dimedove. This is the address where you forward emails from your business accounts.

### Setting Up Email Forwarding

<Note>
The exact steps vary by email provider. Below are general instructions that apply to most services.
</Note>

1. **Access your email settings**: Go to your email provider's settings (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
2. **Find forwarding options**: Look for "Forwarding", "Mail forwarding", or "Rules" section
3. **Add the inbound address**: Enter your Dimedove channel's inbound address as the forwarding destination
4. **Configure forwarding rules**: Choose to forward all emails or create filters for specific senders, subjects, or labels

<Tip>
Copy the inbound address from the channel settings page using the copy button next to the address field.
</Tip>

## Reply Source

Choose how outgoing replies are sent from your email channel.

### Default (Dimedove Address)

Replies are sent from your channel's inbound address. Recipients see the Dimedove domain in the sender field.

- No additional setup required
- Works immediately after channel creation
- Suitable for testing or when custom domain is not needed

### Verified Domain

Replies are sent from your own domain, providing a professional appearance.

- Requires DNS configuration
- Recipients see your business domain as the sender
- Recommended for production use

## Domain Verification

To send replies from your own domain, you must verify ownership through DNS records.

### Starting Verification

1. Enter your domain (e.g., `company.com`) in the domain field
2. Click "Verify" to initiate the verification process
3. Dimedove generates the required DNS records

### DNS Records

After initiating verification, you will see a table of DNS records to add to your domain:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| TXT | Verifies domain ownership |
| CNAME | Configures DKIM email authentication (typically 3 records) |

For each record:
- **Name**: The subdomain or host value to add
- **Value**: The record content to configure
- **Status**: Shows whether the record has been detected

### Adding DNS Records

1. Log into your domain registrar or DNS provider
2. Navigate to DNS management
3. Add each record with the exact Name and Value shown
4. Save your changes

<Warning>
DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate. The verification status will update automatically once records are detected.
</Warning>

### Checking Verification Status

- Click the refresh button to check verification status at any time
- The page automatically checks status periodically after you initiate verification
- Once all records are verified, your domain is ready for use
- Replies will automatically use your verified domain as the sender

## Human Handoff Settings

Configure what happens when a team member replies directly to a customer email.

### Stops Permanently

When a human from your team replies to a customer, the agent stops responding to that email thread permanently.

- Best for situations where human takeover should be final
- Agent will not resume responses regardless of time elapsed
- New email threads from the same customer still receive agent responses

### Resume After Timeout

The agent resumes responding after a configurable period of human inactivity.

- Set the timeout in minutes (1 to 1440, which is 24 hours)
- If no human replies within the timeout period, the agent resumes
- Useful for temporary interventions where agent should eventually continue

## Email Composition

Configure how agent replies are formatted and delivered.

### Email Signature

A custom signature appended to all agent replies from this channel.

- Supports multi-line text
- Include contact information, legal disclaimers, or branding
- Leave empty for no signature

### CC Recipients

Email addresses that receive a copy of every agent reply.

- Add multiple addresses as needed
- Useful for keeping team members informed
- Recipients are visible to the customer

### BCC Recipients

Email addresses that receive a hidden copy of every agent reply.

- Add multiple addresses as needed
- Useful for compliance logging or monitoring
- Recipients are not visible to the customer

### Include Quoted Thread

When enabled, agent replies include the previous email thread below the response.

- Default: Enabled
- Helps recipients see context without scrolling through their inbox
- Disable for shorter, cleaner replies

### Preserve Original CC

When enabled, any CC recipients from the original customer email are included in agent replies.

- Default: Enabled
- Maintains visibility for all parties in the original conversation
- Disable if agent should only reply to the sender
