Email channels extend your AI agents to handle inbound email conversations. Forward emails from your existing business addresses to a dedicated Dimedove address, and your assigned agent will automatically respond to customers on your behalf.

## Key Features

### Inbound Email Forwarding

- Forward emails from any business address (support@, sales@, info@, etc.)
- Each channel receives a unique Dimedove inbound address
- Works with any email provider that supports forwarding (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
- Maintain your existing email addresses while adding AI support

### AI-Powered Responses

- Agent automatically responds to incoming emails
- Full access to your agent's knowledge base and configured tasks
- Consistent tone and messaging across all email responses
- Override instructions allow channel-specific agent behavior

### Custom Domain Replies

- Send replies from your own verified domain instead of a Dimedove address
- Complete DNS verification process with DKIM support
- Professional appearance with replies coming from your business domain
- Fallback to Dimedove address if domain is not verified

### Thread Continuity

### Human Handoff
