<Info>Messenger is available to teams on the Pro subscription.</Info>

Deploy your Dimedove agents to Facebook Messenger. Connect your business pages and start qualifying leads and engaging customers through Messenger in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Messenger, ensure you have:

- A Dimedove account with Pro subscription
- A Facebook Business Page you administer
- At least one Dimedove agent configured and ready to deploy

## Setup Flow

### Step 1: Connect Your Facebook Account

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Dimedove dashboard
2. Go to the **Integrations** tab
3. Click **Configure** next to Facebook Messenger
4. You'll be redirected to Facebook to authorize the connection
5. Grant access to your business pages and click **Allow**
6. Once authorized, you'll be redirected back to Dimedove

Your Facebook account is now connected and your business pages are available for deployment.

### Step 2: Create a Social Channel

1. Navigate to the **Socials** section in your dashboard sidebar
2. Click **Add** to create a new social channel
3. Enter a name for your channel (this is for your internal reference in the dashboard)
4. Select **Messenger** as the channel type

### Step 3: Configure the Channel

Once created, configure your social channel with the following options:

#### Business Page

Select which Facebook business page to connect to this channel. Customers who message this page will be routed to your assigned agent.

<Note>Each business page can only be assigned to one social channel. Pages already connected to another channel will appear as unavailable.</Note>

#### Agent Assignment

Select which Dimedove agent should handle conversations from this page. Choose from your existing agents based on the purpose of the channel.

<Note>The assigned agent must be published and active. If you select an agent that hasn't been published yet, the channel cannot be enabled.</Note>

### Step 4: Enable the Channel

Toggle the channel on from the Socials page or the channel detail view. Your agent will immediately start responding to incoming Messenger conversations.

## How It Works

- When a customer messages your Facebook Business Page, the conversation is routed to your assigned Dimedove agent
- The agent responds directly in Messenger using the same knowledge, instructions, and personality you've configured on the platform
- All conversations appear in your Dimedove Inbox for full visibility alongside your other channels
- Contact profiles are automatically created for Messenger visitors

## Managing Channels

### Enable and Disable

Toggle channels on or off at any time from the Socials page. Disabling a channel stops agent responses without disconnecting the Facebook page. Your configuration is preserved and can be re-enabled instantly.

### Disconnect

Remove a social channel from the Socials page to delete the channel and its page assignment. To disconnect your Facebook account entirely, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** and disconnect from there.

## Benefits

- **Deploy in minutes** - Connect your Facebook pages and start qualifying leads through Messenger in just a few clicks
- **Consistent experience** - Customers receive the same AI-powered qualification across web and social channels
- **Complete visibility** - Every Messenger conversation appears in your Dimedove Inbox
- **Flexible control** - Enable, disable, or reassign agents at any time without disrupting your setup
