The Inbox provides centralized access to all conversations initiated with your agent(s) across multiple channels. It enables businesses to monitor, analyze, and manage customer interactions in real-time from a single workspace that mirrors the dashboard layout (left sidebar for navigation, right pane for detailed chat view).

## Core Capabilities

The Inbox enables businesses to:

- **View conversations across all channels** – Access chats, calls, SMS, and form submissions in a unified interface.
- **Search and filter** – Use the global search box for keyword lookups and apply label-based filters to zoom in on specific intents; active filters are shown as removable chips.
- **Monitor conversation status** – Badges highlight when a user requested human assistance, when the conversation was qualified via performance tooling, or which agent handled the exchange.
- **Access conversation history** – Conversations are ordered by last activity (`last_seen_at`) with timestamps rendered as “time ago” to quickly judge recency; infinite scroll loads older threads.
- **Link conversations to contacts** – Each row shows the recognized contact name (when available) plus a shortcut badge to jump into the contact profile.
- **Track conversation metadata** – Sidebar pills show conversation type (Chat, Call, SMS, Form), associated agent, contact, and applied labels for quick triage.
- **Review AI-generated summaries** – When summaries are enabled, the list uses the AI-generated title/summary pair so you can understand the topic without opening the conversation.
- **Monitor requests for help** – Human-required conversations display a concierge badge both in the list and in the chat toolbar, making escalations easy to spot.

## Conversation Types

The Inbox supports multiple conversation types:

- **Chat** - Standard messenger widget conversations
- **Call** - Voice call interactions with duration tracking
- **SMS** - Text message conversations
- **Form** - Form-based submissions linked to specific team forms

Each type appears with an icon and label in the sidebar so agents can instantly distinguish the source of a thread. Filters respect all channel types, allowing teams to focus on the handoffs that matter most.
