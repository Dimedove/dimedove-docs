Individual contact pages provide detailed views of visitor profiles, enabling businesses to manage structured attributes, view unstructured insights, and track all data collected through agent conversations.

## Contact Profile View

Each contact profile displays:

- **Contact ID** - Unique identifier displayed in breadcrumb navigation
- **Anonymous badge** - Shown when no identifying attributes are populated
- **Last updated timestamp** - When contact attributes were last modified
- **Raw insights access** - Button to view all unstructured insights collected

## Contact Attributes

The contact attributes interface enables businesses to:

- **View all defined attributes** - Display both custom and default attribute fields
- **Edit attribute values** - Update structured data fields directly
- **Track attribute timestamps** - See when each attribute was last updated
- **Identify attribute sources** - Distinguish between AI-inferred and manually-entered data
- **Support multiple input types** - Handle text inputs and text areas (up to 10,000 characters)
- **Auto-populate from conversations** - Attributes can be automatically extracted from chats
- **Manage localized attributes** - Display attribute names in English or French based on user locale

## Attribute Modes

Each attribute can operate in two modes:

### AI-Inferred Mode

- Attributes are automatically extracted from conversation context
- Values populate based on AI analysis of chat content
- Requires "Sync" operation to extract latest conversation data
- Updates automatically when new relevant information is detected

### Manual Mode

- Attributes must be manually entered by team members
- Values are not automatically extracted from conversations
- Provides control over data entry for sensitive or specific fields
- Prevents AI from overwriting manual entries

## Attribute Actions

Businesses can:

- **Save changes** - Update all modified attribute values simultaneously
- **Sync attributes** - Trigger AI extraction of attributes from conversation history
- **Manage attribute definitions** - Access attribute configuration interface
- **Switch attribute modes** - Toggle between AI-inferred and manual for each attribute
- **View unsaved changes** - Indicator shows when modifications haven't been saved

## Attribute Examples and Placeholders

Each attribute displays:

- **Localized name** - Attribute name in user's selected language
- **Example values** - Placeholder text showing expected input format
- **Current value** - Populated data from conversations or manual entry
- **Last modified timestamp** - Relative time since last update
