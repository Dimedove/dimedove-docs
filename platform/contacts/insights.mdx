Contact insights are unstructured key-value data points automatically collected from visitor conversations with AI agents. Unlike structured attributes, insights capture raw information without predefined schemas.

## Core Capabilities

Contact insights enable businesses to:

- **Capture unstructured data** - Collect any information mentioned during conversations
- **Store unlimited key-value pairs** - No limit on types of insights that can be captured
- **Track insight timestamps** - Monitor when each insight was captured
- **Link insights to conversations** - Each insight is associated with a specific chat
- **Review insight history** - View all insights collected over time in chronological order
- **Access raw insight data** - View unprocessed insights before attribute extraction

## Insight Structure

Each insight contains:

- **Key** - The name or label of the insight (e.g., "preferred_contact_time", "pain_point")
- **Value** - The actual data captured (can be text, numbers, or mixed content)
- **Creation timestamp** - When the insight was captured during the conversation
- **Chat association** - Link to the conversation where the insight was captured
- **Contact ID** - The contact profile this insight belongs to
