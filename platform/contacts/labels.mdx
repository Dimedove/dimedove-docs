description: Automatically categorize conversations and drive richer segmentation

Labels help teams organize conversations by intent, lifecycle stage, or any other business signal. Agents auto-assign active labels during a conversation and operators can still adjust them manually from the Inbox.

## Defining labels

Labels live under **Settings → Objects → Labels** in the dashboard.

- **Name** – Friendly label that appears inside the Inbox, filters, and exports.
- **Condition/Description** – Guidance that tells the agent when this label should apply (e.g., “asked for pricing”, “qualified for Enterprise”). This text is used by the agent and reporting surfaces to stay consistent.
- **Color** – Choose a color chip to make labels easy to scan in the conversation header.
- **Active toggle** – Pause or resume a label without deleting it. Inactive labels disappear from assignment menus and automatic logic.
- **Usage counter** – Pay-as-you-go plans unlock a specific label quota; the counter in the header shows how many you have created against that limit.

You can edit or delete labels at any time. All changes are reflected immediately in the Inbox.

## Automatic assignment

After a label is active, Dimedove’s agent will assign it automatically whenever a conversation matches the description you provided. This gives you consistent insights into outcomes such as product fit, urgency, or upsell interest without any manual data entry.

- Labels appear directly beneath each conversation transcript so operators can see what the agent detected.
- Because assignment happens in real time, you can filter the Inbox by intent and trigger downstream automations (e.g., CRM routing or notifications).

## Manual overrides

Operators can refine labeling directly from the conversation toolbar:

1. Open any conversation in the Inbox.
2. Use the **Tag** icon to open the “Manage Labels” dialog.
3. Check or uncheck labels; Dimedove syncs the selection immediately.
4. Remove a chip using the inline “×” if a label should no longer apply to that thread.

Manual edits complement auto-assignment, so the team always has the final say.

## Filtering and reporting

- The Inbox sidebar includes a label filter popover so you can focus on specific intents or remove noise during triage.
- Selected filters appear as chips above the chat list and can be cleared in one click.
- Labels are exported alongside conversations and can be referenced through webhooks for downstream analytics.
