The Contacts section provides a centralized directory of all visitors who have interacted with your agent(s). Contacts are automatically created from conversations and include both structured attributes and unstructured insights.

## Core Capabilities

The Contacts system enables businesses to:

- **Automatically generate contact profiles** - Each conversation creates or updates a contact record
- **Track contact activity** - Monitor last seen timestamps and interaction history
- **Link contacts to conversations** - Navigate between contact profiles and their associated chats
- **Identify contacts across channels** - Track visitors across chat, call, SMS, and form interactions
- **View agent associations** - See which agent(s) have interacted with each contact
- **Search contact directory** - Quickly locate contacts using search functionality
- **Filter by interaction date** - View contacts ordered by most recent activity
- **Access conversation history** - Track chat type and conversation origins

## Contact Information

Each contact profile includes:

- **Contact ID** - Unique identifier for the contact
- **Visitor information** - Device, browser, and session data
- **Last seen timestamp** - Most recent interaction date and time
- **Associated agent** - Agent emoji and name from last conversation
- **Conversation type** - Chat, call, SMS, or form indicator
- **Creation date** - When the contact was first created
- **Team association** - Team ID for multi-tenant organization

## Contact Display Names

The platform automatically determines contact display names using a priority hierarchy:

1. First name + Last name (if both available)
2. First name only
3. Last name only
4. Email address
5. Phone number
6. Any other populated attribute
7. Contact ID (fallback)
