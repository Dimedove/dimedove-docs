title: Manage Attributes
description: Create, edit, and organize custom contact attributes
---

The Manage Attributes view is a shortcut into **Settings → Objects → Attributes**, the primary location where teams configure custom contact fields. Instead of duplicating every option here, follow the [Team Objects → Attributes](../team/manage#attributes) guide for detailed instructions on adding, editing, or deleting attributes, plan limits, and best practices.

## Quick reference

- The list displays both standard and custom attributes with their inference mode (manual vs. AI-inferred) and a usage counter so you always know how many slots remain.
- Clicking **Manage in Settings** opens the full Objects experience where you can create new attributes, edit descriptions, toggle inference mode, or remove custom fields.
- Hovering over an attribute reveals whether it is locked (standard) or editable (custom) and provides immediate cues on the expected data type.
- Use search to jump directly to a specific field without scrolling, then click through to Settings to make deeper changes.

Whenever you update attributes in the Team settings, the changes automatically flow back into Contacts, Forms, and the agent experience—keeping your schema consistent everywhere.
