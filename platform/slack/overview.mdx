<Info>Slack Agents are available to teams on the Pro subscription.</Info>

Slack Agents extend your Dimedove agents beyond your website into your Slack workspace. Deploy agents to public and private channels where team members can interact with them directly, enabling consistent AI-powered qualification and support right where your team already works.

## Key Features

### Workspace Integration

Connect your Slack workspace to Dimedove through a secure OAuth connection. Once connected, you can create multiple Slack Agents and deploy them to different channels based on your needs.

### Channel Support

Deploy agents to the channels where they're needed most:

- **Public Channels**: Make your agent available to everyone in your workspace
- **Private Channels**: Deploy agents to private channels for sensitive discussions or specific teams

<Warning>Slack Agents are not currently available in direct messages. Agents can only be deployed to public and private channels.</Warning>

### Threaded Conversations

All agent responses are organized in threads, keeping channel conversations clean and organized. Team members can continue discussions with the agent within the thread without cluttering the main channel.

### Flexible Response Triggers

Choose how your agent responds to messages:

- **Respond only when @mentioned** (recommended): The agent only responds when explicitly mentioned, reducing noise in active channels
- **Respond to every message in threads**: The agent participates in all thread conversations where it has been mentioned

### Unified Inbox

All Slack conversations appear in your Dimedove Inbox alongside web chat, form, and phone interactions. This gives you complete visibility into every conversation your agents are having, regardless of channel.

## Benefits

- **Standardized Qualification**: Apply consistent qualification criteria across all your Slack channels
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple team members can interact with the same agent in a channel, building on each other's conversations
- **Consistent Responses**: Ensure everyone in your organization receives the same accurate information from your AI agent
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Team members can get answers without leaving Slack
- **Complete Visibility**: Track all agent interactions from your centralized Dimedove dashboard
