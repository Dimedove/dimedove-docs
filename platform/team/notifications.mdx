The notifications command center lets each teammate choose which events should trigger personal alerts—no engineering work required. Notifications are managed per account, so individuals can subscribe without affecting the rest of the team.

## Accessing notification preferences

1. Open **Account → Preferences** inside the dashboard.
2. Select the **Notifications** tab. The command center loads your current subscriptions and shows every event type Dimedove can email today.
3. Use the checkboxes to turn email alerts on or off for each event. Changes are saved instantly.

Dimedove displays a loader while preferences sync so you know when the latest configuration has been fetched.

## Available event types

The starter version of the command center ships with the highest-impact events:

- **Qualified opportunity** – Receive an email whenever your agent qualifies a new opportunity based on performance metrics or labels.
- **Human assistance requested** – Get notified immediately when an agent escalates a conversation or when an operator toggles “requires human” from the conversation toolbar.

Each row displays the event description plus toggles for supported delivery channels (today: email). Additional channels will surface here as they become available.

## When to use webhooks

Need alerts for additional events or want to pipe notifications into another system (Slack, CRM, etc.)? Use the **Webhooks** section under Platform → Webhooks to subscribe to the larger event catalog. Notifications you configure here and webhook subscriptions can coexist, ensuring both technical and non-technical teammates stay in the loop.
