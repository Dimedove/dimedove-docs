# Qualified Opportunities

Every business on a paid Dimedove plan benefits from an **outcomes-based pricing layer**.  
This ensures that, beyond base subscription features, you only pay variable usage when our agents deliver clear business value.

The outcome unit we measure is called a **Qualified Opportunity**.

---

## Definition

A **Qualified Opportunity** represents a conversation where the agent successfully advances a visitor, client, or prospect in a way that meets the business’s own definition of qualification.

This reflects the kind of work a Business Development Representative (BDR) or broker would normally do when turning interest into an opportunity for follow-up.

## How we count

A conversation is counted as **one Qualified Opportunity** when it meets one of the performance metrics defined by the business during agent setup. These criteria, when fulfilled, represent an **inferred Qualified Opportunity**:

1. **Instructions-Aligned Outcome**  
   The conversation counts when the agent achieves the intended outcome described in its **Instructions**. An internal Dimedove evaluation agent determines whether the conversation fulfilled this intent, and records a short rationale.

2. **Task Completion**  
   The conversation counts when the agent completes a specific Task (e.g., _book a demo_, _request a quote_, _handoff to broker_). The Task is selected from the list of Tasks defined in the agent configuration.

3. **Data Signal Collection**  
   The conversation counts when the agent captures a minimum number of qualification datapoints (e.g., _budget_, _timeline_, _intent_, _needs_). The business selects which datapoints matter most, from a predefined list provided by Dimedove.

## Guardrails and transparency

- **One conversation can have at most one Qualified Opportunity.**
- **Businesses configure, but Dimedove enforces guardrails.** This prevents overly complex or unrealistic definitions.
- **Every Qualified Opportunity includes an explanation** (e.g., _“Captured Budget + Timeline + Needs”_ or _“Completed Task: Book demo”_) for transparency.
- **Disputes:** If you believe a Qualified Opportunity was incorrectly counted, contact **billing@dimedove.com** for review.

## Why this matters

This model ensures that:

- You benefit from **variable pricing tied to meaningful outcomes**, not just abstract usage volume.
- Qualification is measured in a way that is **aligned with each your business’s goals**, while remaining **consistent and fair** across all organizations.
- The process is **transparent** — every counted opportunity is logged with a reason.
