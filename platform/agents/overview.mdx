## Built for Growth

Whether you're qualifying your first lead or scaling to handle thousands of conversations, Dimedove agents adapt to your business needs while maintaining the personal touch that converts prospects into customers.

## Managing Multiple Agents

Depending on your team's plan, you can create and manage multiple agents to serve different use cases, audiences, or channels. Each agent operates independently with its own configuration, knowledge base, and conversation history.

### Creating New Agents

Create a new agent from the dashboard by providing a name. Each new agent starts with a default configuration that you can customize to match your specific needs.

### Duplicating Agents

Save time by duplicating an existing agent's configuration. When you duplicate an agent, the following are copied to the new agent:

- **Configuration settings**: All behavior, design, and language settings
- **Tasks**: Task definitions and their input configurations
- **Expertise settings**: Domain expertise and jurisdiction configurations
- **Prompts**: System prompts and instructions

The following are **not** copied and start fresh for the new agent:
- **Content**: Files and websites in the knowledge base (the new agent starts with an empty knowledge base)
- **Preview conversations**: Test conversations from the preview mode

### Assigning Agents to Channels

Once you have multiple agents, you can assign different agents to different channels based on your business needs:

- **Forms**: Assign agents to specific conversational forms for targeted data collection
- **Telephony**: Connect agents to phone numbers for voice and SMS interactions
- **Slack**: Deploy agents to Slack channels for team collaboration and internal qualification

This flexibility allows you to specialize agents for different purposes: one agent might handle general inquiries on your website, while another is optimized for technical support via Slack, and a third focuses on lead qualification through forms.

### Managing Agent Limits

Your team's plan determines how many agents you can create. You can view and manage your agent limits through the billing section in your team settings.
