Define your agent's core identity to ensure consistent and on-brand interactions with prospects and customers.

### Name

### Business Name

Your company name as the agent will reference it in conversations. This appears when your agent mentions your business to prospects and customers.

### Display Name

The name your agent uses when introducing itself to visitors. Leave blank for a generic assistant approach, or provide a specific name for a more personalized experience.

### Description

Your agent's role, purpose, and behavioral guidelines. This is the most important configuration as it shapes how your agent understands its job, responds to inquiries, and maintains your brand voice throughout all interactions.
