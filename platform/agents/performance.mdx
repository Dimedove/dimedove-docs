## Performance Metrics

Configure your agent to track performance through **Qualified Opportunities** - outcome-based pricing that ensures you only pay when agents deliver clear business value.

Choose from three performance criteria during agent setup:

1. **Instructions-Aligned Outcome** - Agent achieves the intended outcome in its Instructions
2. **Task Completion** - Agent completes specific tasks (e.g., book demo, request quote, handoff to broker)  
3. **Data Signal Collection** - Agent captures qualification datapoints (e.g., budget, timeline, intent, needs)
