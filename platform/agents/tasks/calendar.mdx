description: Let visitors book meetings directly within the chat experience

Calendar tasks enable your agent to offer scheduling directly within conversations. When a visitor is ready to book a meeting, your agent presents the calendar widget inline, allowing them to select a time without leaving the chat.

## Supported Providers

Dimedove integrates with two popular scheduling platforms:

- **Calendly** - Widely used scheduling tool with robust calendar integrations
- **Cal.com** - Open-source scheduling platform with flexible customization options

Both providers work seamlessly within the chat interface, providing a consistent booking experience for your visitors.

## Configuration

To set up a calendar task, you need to configure two settings:

### Provider

Select which scheduling platform you use. This determines how the booking widget appears and functions within the chat.

### Event Link

Provide the direct URL to the specific event type you want visitors to book. The format depends on your provider:

- **Calendly**: `https://calendly.com/username/event-name`
- **Cal.com**: `https://cal.com/username/event-name`

Make sure to use the link to a specific event type, not your general scheduling page.

## How It Works

When your agent determines a visitor is ready to book (based on the conversation context and your agent's instructions), it triggers the calendar task:

1. The calendar widget appears directly in the chat interface
2. The visitor selects an available time slot from your calendar
3. They confirm the booking with their details
4. Both you and the visitor receive confirmation

The entire booking flow happens without the visitor ever leaving the conversation, creating a smooth and engaging experience.
