Email tasks enable your agent to send customized emails during conversations. Whether you need to send confirmation emails, follow-up messages, or notifications, email tasks provide flexible templating with dynamic content from your conversations.

## Configuration

### Recipient

Define who receives the email. You have two options:

- **Static** - Enter a fixed email address (e.g., your sales team's inbox)
- **From Input** - Use an email address collected from the visitor during the conversation

For most use cases, you'll want to collect the visitor's email as a task input and reference it here.

### Subject

The email subject line. You can include placeholders to insert dynamic content from task inputs. Placeholders use double curly braces:

```
Thank you for your inquiry, {{firstName}}!
```

### Body

The email body content. Like the subject, you can include placeholders for personalization:

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Thank you for reaching out about {{topic}}.

We'll get back to you within 24 hours.

Best regards,
The Team
```

Line breaks in the body are automatically converted to HTML `<br>` tags when the email is sent.

## Task Inputs

Task inputs define the dynamic information your agent collects from visitors. Each input you create becomes available as a placeholder in your subject and body.

For each input, configure:

- **Name** - Display name for the input
- **Key** - The placeholder key (e.g., `firstName` for `{{firstName}}`)
- **Type** - Data type (text, number, decimal, or boolean)
- **Required** - Whether the agent must collect this before sending
- **AI Inferred** - Whether the agent can extract this from conversation context

Quick-start templates are available for common inputs like first name, last name, email, and phone.

## Testing

Before going live, verify your email configuration:

1. **Preview** - See how your email will look with placeholders rendered
2. **Test Values** - Enter sample values for each input to preview the result
3. **Send Test** - Send an actual test email to verify delivery

The preview shows both the rendered version (with test values) and the raw template (with placeholders visible), so you can verify your templating is correct.
