## Interaction Features

### Attachments

<Info>Attachments are available to teams on the Pro subscription.</Info>

Enable file and image sharing to give visitors the ability to share documents and images directly in their conversations with your agent. When enabled, visitors can upload files using the attachment button in the chat interface.

**Supported Files**:
- Most popular image formats for sharing screenshots, photos, and visual content
- Common document formats including PDFs, spreadsheets, presentations, and text files

**Benefits**:
- **Richer Context**: Visitors can share supporting documents, invoices, contracts, or images that provide context to their questions
- **Document Analysis**: Your agent can analyze and extract information from shared files, reducing the need for visitors to manually describe document contents
- **Reduced Back-and-Forth**: Instead of lengthy explanations, visitors can simply share the relevant file and let the agent extract the necessary information
- **Higher Quality Data**: Collect files directly from conversations for more complete records and follow-up

### Dictation

Enable voice input to let visitors speak their messages instead of typing. When enabled, visitors see a microphone button in the chat interface that activates their device's native speech recognition.

**How It Works**:
- Visitors tap the microphone button to start speaking
- Speech is transcribed to text in real-time using the device's built-in speech recognition
- Recording automatically stops when the visitor finishes speaking
- The transcribed text appears in the input field, where visitors can edit before sending
- Works on both web browsers and mobile devices that support speech recognition

**Benefits**:
- **Accessibility**: Makes your agent accessible to visitors who prefer voice input or have difficulty typing
- **Mobile Convenience**: Ideal for visitors on mobile devices where typing can be cumbersome
- **Hands-Free Input**: Visitors can engage with your agent while multitasking
- **Natural Expression**: Some visitors express themselves more naturally through speech than text

**Language Support**: Dictation automatically uses the agent's default language setting for speech recognition.
