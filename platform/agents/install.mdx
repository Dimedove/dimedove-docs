Dimedove provides a JavaScript widget installation that is easy to implement. Businesses simply add this code to their website:

```html
<dimedove-messenger agent-id="<agent_id>" publishable-key="<publishable_key>" />
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/@dimedove/messenger@latest/dist/messenger.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  async
></script>
```

## Security

It is recommended for businesses to also define **allowed origins** which are whitelisted domains that are allowed to host the messenger.

For more information, consult the [Developer Guides](../../developer-guides/messenger/overview) page.
