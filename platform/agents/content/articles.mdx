description: Create and manage custom articles for your agent's knowledge base

Add custom text content directly to your agent's knowledge base. Articles are simply text-based information that your agent can reference when responding to prospects and customers.

Create articles with any information you want your agent to know - product details, company policies, FAQs, or any other relevant content your agent should be able to discuss.
