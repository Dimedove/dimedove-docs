description: Configure when your agent escalates to human assistance
---

Your agent can automatically mark conversations as requiring human assistance when certain situations arise.

## When Agent Escalates

- **Complex Inquiries**: Questions beyond the agent's knowledge
- **User Requests**: When someone specifically asks to speak with a human
- **Sentiment Detection**: Frustrated or upset visitors
- **Custom Scenarios**: Specific situations you define that require human assistance
