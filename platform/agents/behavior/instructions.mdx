description: Define what your agent does and the journey it creates for visitors
---

Define your agent's core purpose and the experience you want to create for every visitor. Instructions tell your agent what it's trying to accomplish and how to guide visitors through your desired flow.

## What to Define

**Agent Purpose**: What does your agent do? Is it qualifying leads, providing product information, scheduling demos, or handling support inquiries?

**Primary Goal**: What's the main outcome you want from each conversation? A qualified lead, a scheduled call, a purchase, or a resolved question?

**Visitor Journey**: What flow should visitors experience? How do you want to guide them from initial interest to your desired action?

**Success Criteria**: How do you know when your agent has successfully completed its job with a visitor?
