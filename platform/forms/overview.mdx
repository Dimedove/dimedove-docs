Forms provide a powerful way to create standalone, embeddable chat experiences for specific use cases. Unlike the messenger widget which provides a general conversational interface, forms are purpose-built for collecting structured information through conversational interactions.

## Key Features

### Standalone Chat Experience

- Create independent chat interfaces separate from your main messenger
- Embed on landing pages, contact pages, or specific product pages
- Maintain separate conversation contexts for different purposes

### Structured Data Collection

- **Manual Collection**: Agent explicitly asks users for specific information
- **AI-Inferred Collection**: Agent extracts information naturally from conversation context
- Support for multiple field types: text, number, decimal, and boolean
- Required and optional fields with validation

### Agent Customization

- Choose which agent handles form conversations
- Override agent instructions specifically for each form
- Customize first message, conversation starters, and human fallback
- Enable only specific tasks per form

### Form Management

- **Draft Status**: Configure forms safely before going live
- **Live Status**: Enable forms for public access
- **External IDs**: Link form responses to external systems
- **Preview & Testing**: Test forms before deployment

## Benefits

- **Higher Conversion Rates**: Natural conversations reduce form fatigue and improve completion rates
- **Better Data Quality**: Agents ask clarifying questions and validate inputs contextually
- **Personalized Experiences**: Tailor agent behavior, branding, and settings per form
- **Seamless Integration**: Connect to your knowledge base, tasks, and unified inbox
