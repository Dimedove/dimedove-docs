## Form Structure

### Title

- Supports multiple languages

### Description

Brief explanation of the form's purpose displayed to users.

## Form Inputs

Define data fields to collect from users.

### Input Types

**Text** - Single-line text input

**Number** - Integer values only

**Decimal** - Decimal/floating-point numbers

**Boolean** - True/false values

### Input Configuration

Each input field requires:

**Key** (Required)

- Unique identifier for the field
- Used in webhooks and API responses
- Format: lowercase with underscores (e.g., `first_name`)
- Auto-generated from name, can be edited

**Name** (Required)

- Display name for the field
- Shown to users during collection

**Description** (Required)

- Explains what information is needed
- Used by agent to understand collection requirements

**Required**

- Mark if field must be collected
- Agent ensures required fields are obtained

### Input ordering

- Reorder fields using the drag handle to the left of each input.
- The agent follows this sequence when guiding visitors through a form, so you can create intentional flows (e.g., qualification before scheduling).
- Drag-and-drop updates are saved instantly, allowing you to test new sequences without recreating inputs.

Use templates (First Name, Email, Phone, etc.) at the top of the inputs section to seed commonly used questions before fine-tuning their order.

## Collection Mode

**Manual Collection**

- Agent explicitly asks user for this field
- User provides value in response

**AI-Inferred Collection**

- Agent extracts value from conversation context
- No explicit question required
- May not be collected if context is insufficient

## Advanced submission controls

Open the **Advanced** tab of a form to configure automation that keeps completion rates high.

### Auto-submit on inactivity

- Enable **Auto-submit on Inactivity** to let Dimedove finish the form when a visitor stops responding.
- The platform monitors for short periods of inactivity and automatically submits the conversation using all collected answers, ensuring downstream systems still receive a full payload.
- This setting is ideal for long forms or high-intent flows where you want partial data captured even if a prospect drops off.

Combine auto-submit with redirect URLs or post-form webhooks to continue journeys (CRM creation, scheduling links, etc.) even when the visitor abandons the chat near the end.
