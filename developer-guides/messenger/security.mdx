## Security

It is recommended for businesses to also define **allowed origins** which are whitelisted domains that are allowed to host the messenger.

- **Allowed Origins (Whitelist)**: Define whitelisted domains allowed to host the messenger
- **HTTPS**: Always use secure connections
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Publishable Key**: Use publishable keys for client-side integration
- **CORS Validation**: Cross-origin resource sharing validation
- **Server-side Validation**: Validate requests on your backend
