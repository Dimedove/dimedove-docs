## What Are Cookies and Similar Technologies?

**Cookies** are small text files that websites store on a visitor's device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings for the purpose of tracking user activity, helping visitors navigate between pages efficiently, remembering preferences, improving the browsing experience, and enabling functionality, analytics, and security features.

**Local Storage (including HTML5)** functions like cookies but enables the storage of larger amounts of data and persists until explicitly cleared by the user or application.

**Session Storage** temporarily stores data during a browser session and is automatically deleted when the browser tab is closed.

**Web Beacons** (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are typically used to track whether a webpage or email was accessed, opened, or specific content was viewed or clicked.

**Authentication Tokens** are secure credentials used to verify user identity and maintain secure access to the platform without requiring repeated login credentials.

**CSRF Tokens** are security tokens used to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks by validating that requests originate from authorized sources.
